### About me
I'm a systems-oriented thinker with a background in nonprofit operatons and psychology. With experience in customer-facing roles focused on user experience, internal operations, and project management, I'm excited to bring ideas and perspectives around employing human-centered design in managing team collaboration and workflow to a company that builds software that helps other teams work more smoothly and efficiently.
